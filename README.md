# Sneakerz

<h4>An Android Application for Tracking Running Shoe Mileage.</h4>
<p>Sneakerz allows users to store data about their shoes including a name, image, and the current distance they have run in them.
Each shoe can also be associated with individual runs. Users can record run length and time; the date of each run is also saved.</p>

<h4>Data Storage</h4>
<p>All data is stored in an SQLite database except for the shoe images. These are written to the external public image storage
directory, so they are readily available for the user.</p>
